# LOAD-re-analysis

Re-working early stages of WGMS data processing to identify bug.

## Background

Inconsistency was found between first batch of gemBS alignments from c. 2023 to a re-alignment done in 2025. Extract step has been tentatively ruled out. It seems to be further upstream.

Focus of this repo will be on four samples which have been examined more closely: 101, 216, 231, 392.
